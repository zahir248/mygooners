## Routes

### Client Routes
```php
Route::prefix('checkout')->middleware('auth')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/refunds', [RefundController::class, 'index'])->name('checkout.refunds');
    Route::get('/refunds/{refund}', [RefundController::class, 'show'])->name('checkout.refunds.show');
    Route::get('/orders/{order}/refund', [RefundController::class, 'create'])->name('checkout.refunds.create');
    Route::post('/orders/{order}/refund', [RefundController::class, 'store'])->name('checkout.refunds.store');
});
```

### Admin Routes
```php
Route::prefix('refunds')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/', [RefundController::class, 'index'])->name('admin.refunds.index');
    Route::get('/{refund}', [RefundController::class, 'show'])->name('admin.refunds.show');
    Route::patch('/{refund}/status', [RefundController::class, 'updateStatus'])->name('admin.refunds.update-status');
    Route::get('/export', [RefundController::class, 'export'])->name('admin.refunds.export');
    Route::get('/stats', [RefundController::class, 'getStats'])->name('admin.refunds.stats');
});
```

## Business Logic

### Refund Eligibility
- Order must be in 'delivered' status
- Must be within 3 days of delivery date
- User cannot have active refund requests for the same order

### Refund Types
1. **Refund Only**: User gets money back, keeps the item
2. **Return & Refund**: User returns item and gets money back
3. **Replace/Exchange**: User gets replacement item (handled as new order)

### Status Flow
1. **Pending**: Initial status when refund is requested
2. **Approved**: Admin approves the refund request
3. **Processing**: Refund is being processed
4. **Completed**: Refund is finished, order status updated to 'refunded'
5. **Rejected**: Admin rejects the refund with reason

### Order Status Integration
- When refund is completed, order status changes to 'refunded'
- Payment status also changes to 'refunded'
- If refund status is reverted from completed, order status returns to 'delivered'
