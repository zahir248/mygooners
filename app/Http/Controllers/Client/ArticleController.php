<p>The 26-year-old forward has been a long-term target for Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who has been looking to strengthen the club\'s attacking options. The player scored 28 goals in 34 league appearances last season and has been one of Europe\'s most sought-after talents.</p>

<p>"We are delighted to welcome our new striker to Arsenal," said Arteta in a press conference. "He is a player who brings not only goals but also the winning mentality that we need to compete at the highest level. His experience and quality will be invaluable to our squad."</p>

<p>The signing represents Arsenal\'s continued ambition to compete for major trophies and demonstrates the club\'s commitment to backing their manager in the transfer market. The player is expected to make his debut in the upcoming match against Liverpool.</p>

<p>Arsenal fans have been eagerly awaiting this announcement, with many taking to social media to express their excitement about the new addition to the squad. The striker will wear the number 9 shirt, which has been vacant since the departure of the previous striker last season.</p>',
