# Inline Embeds Example

## How It Works

### Step 1: Add Embed Codes
In the article form, add your embed codes:
- **Twitter/X Embed Code**: `<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">...</blockquote>`
- **Facebook Embed Code**: `<div class="fb-post">...</div>`
- **Instagram Embed Code**: `<blockquote class="instagram-media">...</blockquote>`

### Step 2: Write Your Article
In the TinyMCE editor, write your article content:

```
The Arsenal match was incredible! Here's what the fans were saying:

[TWITTER_EMBED]

The team's performance was outstanding, and this tweet perfectly captures the mood.

[INSTAGRAM_EMBED]

As you can see from this Instagram post, the celebrations were wild!

[FACEBOOK_EMBED]

The Facebook community also had some great reactions to share.
```

### Step 3: Insert Embed Placeholders
Instead of typing `[TWITTER_EMBED]` manually, use the TinyMCE toolbar buttons:
1. Click where you want the embed
2. Click the "Twitter" button in the toolbar
3. The placeholder `[TWITTER_EMBED]` will be inserted automatically

### Step 4: Save and View
When you save the article, the placeholders will be replaced with the actual embeds, appearing exactly where you placed them in the content.

## Result
Your article will display:
- Text: "The Arsenal match was incredible! Here's what the fans were saying:"
